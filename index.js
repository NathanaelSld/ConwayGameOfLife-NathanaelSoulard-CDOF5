// Implementation of CLI for Conway's Game of Life
// RULES of the game :
//  - Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.
//  - Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
//  - Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.
//  - Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
//
// Alive cells will be represented by # and dead cells will be represented by .
